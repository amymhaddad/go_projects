/*
Questions:

1. why is got returning all values 2 times when I input data into the GetAllBooks() funcition
got := bookstore.GetAllBooks()

2. Do I have this right:
//Create a slice of type Book -- in bookstore.go file
var Books = []Book{}

//Create a slice of type Book -- in test file -- and add books to it
bookstore.Books = []bookstore.Book{book1, book2}

3. Is my test correct? It passes but why don't I see values for want and got ?

4. Ask about TestBook() -- what's it doing?

5. Are my fucntions correct in bookstore.go?
